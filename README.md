# Plain JavaScript DOM Manipulations.

In this repository, you will practice manipulating the DOM directly by creating a portfolio.

## Objectives

  - Manipulate the DOM directly through by appending and removing DOM elements.
  - Use CSS to hide and display elements on the page.
  - Add event handlers to interact with user actions on the page.

## Setup

Open `index.html` in the browser.

## Basic Requirements

_Note: Do not use jQuery for any of this! The purpose of this activity is to make you comfortable with DOM manipulations using plain JavaScript._

    - Create an input text box for the project title.
